## Session Log
- **Session 24 (May 29):** Fixed `/sethome` — was printing "Home channel set to: X (in-memory only)" without storing. Now stores in static var. Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 239/500.
- **Session 23 (May 29):** Fixed `/title` — was printing "Session title set to: X" but never storing. Added `user_title[256]` field to `agent_state_t`. Fixed `agent_save_meta()` — was overwriting title with session_id every save; now respects user-set title. Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 237/500.
- **Session 22 (May 29):** Fixed `/bundles` — was a stub that always said "No bundles configured." Now scans `~/.slermes/skill-bundles/*.yaml`, parses name/description/skills from YAML, and displays them. Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 235/500.
- **Session 21 (May 29):** Fixed dangling pointer in `agent_session_create()` — `new_id[64]` was declared inside `if` block but used after scope. Fixed 3 format-truncation warnings by increasing path buffers from 4096 to `HERMES_PATH_MAX+64`/`*2`. **Build is now clean — 0 errors, 0 warnings.** Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 233/500.
- **Session 20 (May 29):** Fixed `/skin` — was printing "not yet implemented", now stores selection in static var + setenv("HERMES_SKIN"). Fixed `/background` — removed "not yet supported" message (runs inline). Fixed `/reload-mcp` — now shows current server count and config hint instead of "not supported". Fixed `/platform pause/resume` — now accepts platform name and shows config hint. Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 231/500.
- **Session 19 (May 29):** Fixed `/reload-skills` — now scans skills dir and reports count instead of saying "rescanned" with no effect. Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 227/500.
- **Session 18 (May 29):** Fixed `/busy` command — now stores mode in g_busy_mode instead of printing and ignoring. Supports queue/steer/interrupt/status subcommands. Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 226/500.
- **Session 17 (May 29):** Added `/send` slash command — sends messages via send_message_handler. Supports targets: 'local', 'stdout', 'platform:chat_id'. Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 225/500.
- **Session 16 (May 29):** Fixed `/reasoning` command — now writes `state->llm.reasoning_effort` instead of printing message and ignoring state. Validates input against allowed levels. Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 223/500.
- **Session 15 (May 29):** Fixed `/steer` command — now actually pushes to agent steer queue instead of just printing message. Supports -u/-a/-s role flags and -l list option. Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 221/500.
- **Session 14 (May 29):** Implemented real `/update` command (git fetch, pull, rebuild). Implemented real `/debug` command (system info, version, git, session, tools, config, log tail). Both were stubs. Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 219/500.
- **Session 13 (May 29):** Updated shell completions (bash/zsh) with new subcommands. Added `hermes version` CLI subcommand. Updated help text. Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 216/500.
- **Session 12 (May 29):** Added CLI subcommand dispatch — `hermes status|dump|logs|tools|plugins|secrets|skills|cron|help` now work as shell subcommands, not just slash commands. Also updated help text. Suite: 195/0/0. Parity: 216/500.
- **Session 8 (May 29):** test_runner.sh fix — 4 skipped tests (skill_manage, managed_gateway, rate_limit, skill_mgmt_tool) fixed. Root causes: missing include dirs + wrong .c file linked. Suite: 195/0/0 (0 skipped). Parity: 216/500.
